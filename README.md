### Project Description
[A funny, interactive website that looks like a musical instrument (like a piano, guitar, or drum set) ‚Äî but instead of playing real instrument sounds, it plays silly or unexpected sounds]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People are getting bored of hearing the same old guitar strums and piano keys. Music feels too... normal.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[we decided to replace traditional instrument sounds with random animal and funny effects, because... why not?]
